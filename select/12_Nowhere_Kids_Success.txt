Saturday mornings spent skating through the break of dusk
we were lost, nowhere to go
and we wonder why they rush through life to put blinders on
if you want happiness don't tell a soul...
that's the only thing you need to know

our whole lives they all looked down on us
so we were forced now, to go out on our own
so we turned to the only thing that inspires us
the sound waves on your radio

If you had a chance to live your life,
why would you just choose to die
instead of waiting for the end of days
feels like you're at the bottom of the list
but there's hope for suburban kids
the city sounds will lead the way

we are the nowhere kids
screaming out your stereo
with no place left to go

In the land of dirt and plaster
Lies an army of a thousand nowhere kids
Losing ground and falling faster
Into a life that no one should have to live

We are the people that you hate
We are the bastards that you created
A generation with no place
A generation of all your sons and daughters

Behind the fake family image
Behind the smile of a thousand moms and dads
Inside the cage that we've been given
I see an image of the future that we don't have

We are the people that you hate
We are the bastards that you created
A generation with no place
A generation of all your sons and...
We are the people that you hate
The fucking bastards that you created
A generation with no place
A generation of all your sons and daughters

And what did you expect?
A perfect child?
Raised by TV sets
Abandoned every mile
We never get respect
Never a fair trial
No one gives a shit
As long as we smile
Smile
Smile

We are the people that you hate
We are the bastards that you created
A generation with no place
A generation of all your sons and...
We are the people that you hate
The fucking bastards that you created
A generation with no place
A generation of all your sons and daughters
